I started in the world of research in the University of Granada in an unexpected way. When I was finishing my civil engineering degree, I was looking for another career to pursue because I did not feel comfortable in that field. It was then that I discovered the Ultrasonics Lab at the University of Granada, where they applied the knowledge learned to biomechanics. That really caught my attention and enthusiasm quickly. This opportunity allowed me to become a co-founder of the spin-off [Innitius](https://www.innitius.com/). At the same time, a colleague specialized in law and patents proposed me to start a small project to help bring technology-based ideas to fruition, doing feasibility studies and protection of ideas. However, it was a task that required more time from us.

Since then, I have been looking for opportunities to diversify my training and see with different eyes a future that I had not even thought of. I am much more interested in applied research, which is not merely an explanation of fundamentals, which of course is also essential. Here my contact with physicians during certain projects to which I have been assigned has played a very important role. One realizes that multidisciplinarity is not only the combination of two a priori very different fields, but also the understanding of the point of view and way of working of others. I note that the system in Spain for obtaining a stable academic or scientific position is bordering on unhealthy competition. Therefore, I hope that my future lies in professional non-destructive evaluation, as I would like to work on truly revolutionary techniques that will help both industry and medicine. I believe that the course can give me that point of view outside the classical academic world.
