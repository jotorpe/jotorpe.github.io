   abstract = {A novel torsional wave sensor designed to characterize mechanical properties of soft tissues is presented in this work. Elastography is a widely used technique since the 1990s to map tissue stiffness. Moreover, quantitative elastography uses the velocity of shear waves to achieve the shear stiffness. This technique exhibits significant limitations caused by the difficulty of the separation between longitudinal and shear waves and the pressure applied while measuring. To overcome these drawbacks, the proposed torsional wave sensor can isolate a pure shear wave, avoiding the possibility of multiple wave interference. It comprises a rotational actuator disk and a piezoceramic receiver ring circumferentially aligned. Both allow the transmission of shear waves that interact with the tissue before being received. Experimental tests are performed using tissue mimicking phantoms and cervical tissues. One contribution is a sensor sensitivity study that has been conducted to evaluate the robustness of the new proposed torsional wave elastography (TWE) technique. The variables object of the study are both the applied pressure and the angle of incidence sensor–phantom. The other contribution consists of a cervical tissue characterization. To this end, three rheological models have fit the experimental data and a static independent testing method has been performed. The proposed methodology permits the reconstruction of the mechanical constants from the propagated shear wave, providing a proof of principle and warranting further studies to confirm the validity of the results.},

   abstract = {The clinical ultrasound community demands mechanisms to obtain the viscoelastic biomarkers of soft tissue in order to quantify the tissue condition and to be able to track its consistency. Torsional Wave Elastography (TWE) is an emerging technique proposed for interrogating soft tissue mechanical viscoelastic constants. Torsional waves are a particular configuration of shear waves, which propagate asymmetrically in-depth and are radially transmitted by a disc and received by a ring. This configuration is shown to be particularly efficient in minimizing spurious p-waves components and is sensitive to mechanical constants, especially in cylinder-shaped organs. The objective of this work was to validate (TWE) technique against Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) technique through the determination of shear wave velocity, shear moduli, and viscosity of ex vivo chicken liver samples and tissue mimicking hydrogel phantoms. The results of shear moduli for ex vivo liver tissue vary 1.69&ndash;4.0kPa using TWE technique and 1.32&ndash;4.48kPa using SWEI technique for a range of frequencies from 200 to 800Hz. Kelvin&ndash;Voigt viscoelastic parameters reported values of    &mu;    = 1.51kPa and    &eta;    = 0.54Pa&middot;s using TWE and    &mu;    = 1.02kPa and    &eta;    = 0.63Pa&middot;s using SWEI. Preliminary results show that the proposed technique successfully allows reconstructing shear wave velocity, shear moduli, and viscosity mechanical biomarkers from the propagated torsional wave, establishing a proof of principle and warranting further studies.},

   abstract = {The adoption of multiscale approaches by the biomechanical community has caused a major improvement in quality in the mechanical characterization of soft tissues. The recent developments in elastography techniques are enabling in vivo and non-invasive quantification of tissues&rsquo; mechanical properties. Elastic changes in a tissue are associated with a broad spectrum of pathologies, which stems from the tissue microstructure, histology and biochemistry. This knowledge is combined with research evidence to provide a powerful diagnostic range of highly prevalent pathologies, from birth and labor disorders (prematurity, induction failures, etc.), to solid tumors (e.g., prostate, cervix, breast, melanoma) and liver fibrosis, just to name a few. This review aims to elucidate the potential of viscous and nonlinear elastic parameters as conceivable diagnostic mechanical biomarkers. First, by providing an insight into the classic role of soft tissue microstructure in linear elasticity; secondly, by understanding how viscosity and nonlinearity could enhance the current diagnosis in elastography; and finally, by compounding preliminary investigations of those elastography parameters within different technologies. In conclusion, evidence of the diagnostic capability of elastic parameters beyond linear stiffness is gaining momentum as a result of the technological and imaging developments in the field of biomechanics.},

   abstract = {Pregnancy involves a gradual change in tissue consistency, where, as gestational age increases a drop in stiffness is noticeable. The extracellularmatrix (ECM) of the cervixwhose behavior is controlled by the collagen structure is reconfigured, due to hormonal and protein related factors that degraded it. There is an increase in cellular andwater content.Thecollagenmaintains a stable percentage, although the synthesis-solubility interaction causes a transformation in the network increasing its diameter and waviness, which destabilizes themechanical integrity. Further understanding of the remodeling of the cervix becomes a key element in the progress against preterm birth. However, since the woman is in a very delicate state, the available information is scattered.The aim is to provide a framework where the variation of the histological properties is linked with the individual biomechanical evolution of the constituents; therefore a multiscale approach to the problem can be made. The results of different authors were reviewed to obtain values of each component depending on the gestational age, and then they were combined with the mechanical development of each variable obtained from the outputs of numerical simulations of another author. An additive function is proposed, in which the mechanical contribution of each constituent is added to a reference value established for a nonpregnant state. Results show how biochemistry models the mechanical behavior of the tissue through the histology and morphology of the ECM.},

@article{Gomez2021,
   abstract = {Experimental evidence on testing a non-ultrasonic-based probe for a new approach in transluminal elastography was presented. The proposed modality generated shear waves by inducing oscillatory rotation on the lumen wall. Detection of the propagated waves was achieved at a set of receivers in mechanical contact with the lumen wall. The excitation element of the probe was an electromagnetic rotational actuator whilst the sensing element was comprised by a uniform anglewise arrangement of four piezoelectric receivers. The prototype was tested in two soft-tissue-mimicking phantoms that contained lumenlike conduits and stiffer inclusions. The shear wave speed of the different components of the phantoms was characterized using shear wave elastography. These values were used to estimate the time-of-flight of the expected reflections. Ultrafast ultrasound imaging, based on Loupas’ algorithm, was used to estimate the displacement field in transversal planes to the lumenlike conduit and to compare against the readouts from the transluminal transmission–reception tests. Experimental observations between ultrafast imaging and the transluminal probe were in good agreement, and reflections due to the stiffer inclusions were detected by the transluminal probe. The obtained experimental evidence provided proof-of-concept for the transluminal elastography probe and encouraged further exploration of clinical applications.},

@article{Ashofteh20,
   abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate which hyperelastic model could best describe the non-linear mechanical behavior of the cornea, in order to characterize the capability of the non-linear model parameters to discriminate structural changes in a damaged cornea. Porcine corneas were used, establishing two different groups: control (non-treated) and NaOH-treated (damaged) corneas (n = 8). NaOH causes a chemical burn to the corneal tissue, simulating a disease associated to structural damage of the stromal layer. Quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests were performed in nasal-temporal direction immediately after preparing corneal strips from the two groups. Three non-linear hyperelastic models (i.e. Hamilton-Zabolotskaya model, Ogden model and Mooney-Rivlin model) were fitted to the stress–strain curves obtained in the tensile tests and statistically compared. The corneas from the two groups showed a non-linear mechanical behavior that was best described by the Hamilton-Zabolotskaya model, obtaining the highest coefficient of determination (R2 &gt; 0.95). Moreover, Hamilton-Zabolotskaya model showed the highest discriminative capability of the non-linear model parameter (Parameter A) for the tissue structural changes between the two sample groups (p = 0.0005). The present work determines the best hyperelastic model with the highest discriminative capability in description of the non-linear mechanical behavior of the cornea.},

   abstract = {Corneal mechanical changes are believed to occur before any visible structural alterations observed during routine clinical evaluation. This study proposed developing an elastography technique based on torsional waves (TWE) adapted to the specificities of the cornea. By measuring the displacements in the propagation plane perpendicular to the axis of the emitter, the effect of guided waves in plate-like media was proven negligible. Ex vivo experiments were carried out on porcine corneal samples considering a group of control and one group of alkali burn treatment ( $$\hbox \{NH\}_\text \{4\}$$ OH) that modified the mechanical properties. Phase speed was recovered as a function of intraocular pressure (IOP), and a Kelvin-Voigt rheological model was fitted to the dispersion curves to estimate viscoelastic parameters. A comparison with uniaxial tensile testing with thin-walled assumptions was also performed. Both shear elasticity and viscosity correlated positively with IOP, being the elasticity lower and the viscosity higher for the treated group. The viscoelastic parameters ranged from 21.33 to 63.17 kPa, and from 2.82 to 5.30 Pa s, for shear elasticity and viscosity, respectively. As far as the authors know, no other investigations have studied this mechanical plane under low strain ratios, typical of dynamic elastography in corneal tissue. TWE reflected mechanical properties changes after treatment, showing a high potential for clinical diagnosis due to its rapid performance time and paving the way for future in vivo studies.},

   abstract = {The mechanical status of the cervix is a key physiological element during pregnancy. By considering a successful induction when the active phase of labor is achieved, mapping the mechanical properties of the cervix could have predictive potential for the management of induction protocols. In this sense, we performed a preliminary assessment of the diagnostic value of using shear wave elastography before labor induction in 54 women, considering the pregnancy outcome and Cesarean indications. Three anatomical cervix regions and standard methods, such as cervical length and Bishop score, were compared. To study the discriminatory power of each diagnostic method, a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated. Differences were observed using the external os region and cervical length in the failure to enter the active phase group compared to the vaginal delivery group (p < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve resulted in 68.9%, 65.2% and 67.2% for external os, internal os and cervix box using elastography, respectively, compared to 69.5% for cervical length and 62.2% for Bishop score. External os elastography values have shown promise in predicting induction success. This a priori information could be used to prepare a study with a larger sample size, which would reduce the effect of any bias selection and increase the predictive power of elastography compared to other classical techniques.},
